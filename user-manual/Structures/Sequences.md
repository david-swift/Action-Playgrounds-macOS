# Sequences

Nodes are executed at the moment when all of the output parameters connected to the nodeâ€™s input parameters have got a value. By creating chains of nodes, each node is executed after each other in the order you would expect.

This is an example of a really simple sequence:

![A Sequence][image-1]

And this is a more complex one:

![A Sequence][image-2]
